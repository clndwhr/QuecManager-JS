- reworked ping / latency feature
- reworked memory fetching feature
- added ToS
- adjusted dashboard navigation responsiveness to show sheet (hamburger menu) with lg (1024) screen sizes
- separated the public IP fetching from the main data fetching

!TODO:
- rework data connection state
- rework public ip address (currently makes the whole home data freeze in load state if theres no internet available)
