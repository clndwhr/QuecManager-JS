# QuecManager Beta Version 2.2.8 Release Candidate - Hotfix Update

## **Critical Hotfixes & System Improvements**

### **Memory Monitoring System - Persistence & Reliability Fixes**
- **Fixed Memory Settings Persistence**: Resolved critical issue where memory monitoring settings would not persist across device reboots
- **Conditional Service Startup**: Implemented intelligent daemon startup that only runs when memory monitoring is enabled in configuration
- **Simplified CORS Handling**: Streamlined CORS headers in `fetch_memory.sh`
- **Config-First Architecture**: Memory card component now checks configuration before attempting data fetches, improving loading states and error handling
- **Optimistic Loading**: Memory data displays immediately when configuration is enabled, eliminating unnecessary loading delays

### **Ping Latency System - Complete Rework**
- **Unified Architecture**: Completely reworked ping latency fetching to match the simplified memory system pattern for consistency
- **New Configuration Service**: Created `ping_service.sh` to provide ping settings via clean JSON API, matching memory service pattern
- **Simplified Data Fetching**: Replaced complex `fetch_ping.sh` (67 lines) with streamlined version (39 lines) using direct JSON file reading
- **Fixed Interval Handling**: Resolved critical bug where ping refreshed every 2 seconds despite 5-second configuration - now properly respects config intervals
- **Config-First Component**: Updated `ping-card.tsx` to use same config-first approach as memory card, eliminating complex animation logic
- **Conditional Daemon Management**: Ping daemon now starts conditionally based on `PING_ENABLED` configuration, matching memory daemon behavior

### **Ethernet Hardware Detection - Error Prevention**
- **Pre-Connection Validation**: Enhanced `fetch_hw_details.sh` to check Ethernet interface existence and status before attempting ethtool operations
- **Graceful Disconnection Handling**: Script now returns proper "Not Connected" state instead of throwing errors when Ethernet is unplugged
- **Multi-State Detection**: Distinguishes between interface down, no physical link, and ethtool failures with appropriate responses
- **Enhanced Component Logic**: Updated `ethernet-card.tsx` to properly handle disconnected states with visual indicators and "Not Available" labels
- **Improved Error Recovery**: Component now shows proper connection states instead of error messages when hardware is unavailable

### **UI Component Updates**

- **Fixed Cell Scan Feature Access**: Restored accidentally removed component for Cell Scan Feature

## üêõ **Critical Bug Fixes**

### **Memory System Reliability**
- **Fixed Reboot Persistence**: Memory monitoring settings now survive device reboots and maintain user preferences
- **Eliminated Random 500 Errors**: Simplified CORS handling prevents intermittent fetch failures
- **Fixed Loading States**: Memory card no longer shows indefinite loading when service is disabled

### **Ping System Accuracy**
- **Fixed Interval Timing**: Ping latency now refreshes at correct intervals
- **Stable Polling**: Eliminated unnecessary useEffect dependencies that caused polling restarts

### **Ethernet Hardware Robustness**
- **Prevented Script Errors**: Ethernet script no longer fails when interface is down or cable is unplugged
- **Improved Error Messages**: Users see "Not Connected" instead of technical error messages
- **Visual State Indicators**: Proper red/green icon states for connected/disconnected Ethernet

## üîß **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Script Optimizations**
- **fetch_memory.sh**: Simplified from complex awk parsing to direct JSON file reading with basic validation
- **fetch_ping.sh**: Reduced from 67 to 39 lines with streamlined logic and simplified CORS
- **ping_service.sh**: New configuration service providing ping settings via clean JSON API
- **fetch_hw_details.sh**: Enhanced with pre-validation checks and graceful disconnection handling

### **React Component Improvements**
- **memory-card.tsx**: Config-first architecture with optimistic loading and simplified state management
- **ping-card.tsx**: Eliminated complex animation logic, fixed dependency issues, added proper interval logging
- **ethernet-card.tsx**: Enhanced disconnection handling with improved visual states

## üîÑ **Migration & Deployment Notes**

- **Ethernet Monitoring**: No user action required

## üìã **Summary of Changes**

This hotfix update focuses on critical reliability improvements and system consistency.
