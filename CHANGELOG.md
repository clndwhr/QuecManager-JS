# QuecManager Beta Version 2.2.8 Release Candidate

## üöÄ **Major Features & Improvements**

### **Network Insights System - Complete Overhaul**
- **Dynamic Event Categorization**: Completely reworked network insights interpreter with intelligent categorization for Band Changes, Carrier Aggregation Changes, Network Mode Changes, and No Signal events
- **Comprehensive QCAINFO Parsing**: Advanced parsing engine for both LTE and NR5G bands with accurate band detection and signal interpretation
- **Human-Readable Interpretations**: Automatic generation of detailed, technical context for network events with professional explanations
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Automated 61-second polling intervals with intelligent event detection and processing
- **Service Integration**: Seamless integration with QuecManager services for automatic startup and lifecycle management
- **Deployment Validation**: Comprehensive test suite for OpenWrt deployment verification and system validation

### **Memory Monitoring System - Complete Rewrite**
- **Dynamic Service Management**: Memory monitoring now uses dynamic service configuration instead of static initialization
- **Simplified Architecture**: Streamlined memory daemon system with automatic service lifecycle management
- **Enhanced Memory Card Component**: Intelligent state management with configuration awareness and real-time status indicators
- **Optimistic Loading**: Memory data loads immediately when available, with separate loading states for better UX
- **Error-Free UI**: Removed error states from memory card - shows only loading skeletons or actual data

### **Network Latency (Ping) System - Enhanced**
- **Improved Ping Configuration**: Better handling of ping settings with dynamic enable/disable functionality
- **Real-time Status Updates**: Live ping monitoring with proper state synchronization
- **Settings Integration**: Seamless integration with personalization settings for ping configuration

### **Public IP Fetching - Non-Blocking Architecture**
- **Separated Data Flow**: Public IP now fetches independently from main data, eliminating blocking behavior
- **Progressive Loading**: Main dashboard data (SIM, connection, bands) loads immediately while public IP loads separately
- **Intelligent Loading States**: Specific loading skeleton only for public IP field while other data displays instantly
- **Internet Connectivity Validation**: Enhanced public IP script with ping-based connectivity checking before HTTP requests

## üé® **User Interface & Experience**

### **Legal Compliance**
- **Terms of Service**: Added comprehensive Terms of Service with Quectel non-affiliation disclaimers
- **Privacy Policy**: Enhanced privacy documentation with third-party separation clarifications

### **Navigation Improvements**
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusted dashboard navigation to show hamburger menu on lg (1024px) screen sizes
- **Mobile Navigation**: Fixed outdated mobile navigation components for better accessibility

### **Personalization Settings**
- **Memory Settings Integration**: Added memory monitoring controls to personalization page
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Real-time settings updates with proper event dispatching

## üêõ **Bug Fixes & Performance**

### **Data Loading Issues**
- **Fixed Frozen Loading States**: Resolved issue where all data would freeze on loading when public IP fetch failed

### **Network Reliability**
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved error handling for network connectivity issues
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Better fallback behavior when internet connectivity is unavailable

## üîß **Technical Improvements**

### **Backend Scripts**
- **Network Insights Infrastructure**: Complete shell-based interpreter system with POSIX compliance and BusyBox compatibility
- **Memory System Scripts**: Complete rewrite of memory daemon, service management, and configuration scripts
- **Fetch Scripts**: Enhanced `fetch_memory.sh` with comprehensive error handling and validation
- **Service Integration**: Dynamic service file manipulation for memory daemon management
- **Robust Datetime Handling**: GNU date fallbacks for BusyBox environments with string-based comparison systems

### **React Components**
- **Hook Optimizations**: Separated concerns in data fetching hooks for better performance
- **State Management**: Improved state management across memory and network components
- **Component Architecture**: Cleaner component hierarchy with better separation of loading states
- **Network Insights UI**: New React components for displaying categorized network events with real-time updates

### **Error Handling**
- **Graceful Degradation**: Components now handle missing data more gracefully
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Better error messages and loading indicators throughout the application

## üìà **Performance Metrics**

- **Faster Initial Load**: Main dashboard data now appears faster
- **Non-Blocking Operations**: Public IP fetching no longer blocks other data display
- **Reduced Loading Time**: Memory component shows data immediately when available
- **Optimized Polling**: Separate polling intervals for different data types (15s main, 30s public IP, 2s memory, 61s network insights)
- **Intelligent Event Processing**: Network insights processing optimized for minimal system impact

## üîÑ **Migration Notes**

- Memory monitoring may need to be re-enabled in personalization settings after update
- Network insights interpreter will automatically integrate with existing QuecManager services
- No breaking changes to user interface or existing functionality
- Run chmod +x on the cgi-bin directory or new scripts to enable execution
- OpenWrt users should run the deployment test script to validate network insights compatibility
