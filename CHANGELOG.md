## **üîß Core System Infrastructure**

### **Centralized Logging System - Complete Implementation**

- **Backend Infrastructure**: Built comprehensive centralized logging framework
  - Created `quecmanager_logger.sh` - Core logging framework with automatic rotation at 500KB
  - Implemented `/tmp/quecmanager/logs/` directory structure with categorized subdirectories (daemons/, services/, settings/, system/)
  - Added `quecmanager_logging` init.d service (START=48) for logging system initialization and maintenance
  - Deployed automatic log cleanup daemon running every 6 hours to prevent storage issues
  - Standardized log format: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] [LEVEL] [SCRIPT] [PID:xxxx] Message`

- **Service Integration**: Migrated all core services to centralized logging
  - Updated `memory_daemon`, `ping_daemon`, `quecwatch`, `quecprofile` to use centralized logging
  - Enhanced `at_queue_manager.sh` with comprehensive logging and CGI debugging capabilities
  - Implemented dual logging (centralized + system) for critical services

- **Web API**: Created robust log access system
  - Built `/cgi-bin/quecmanager/experimental/logs/fetch_logs.sh` API for web-based log access
  - Implemented JSON response format with category/script/level filtering
  - Added pagination and search capabilities for large log files

### **System Logs - New Experimental Feature**

- **Frontend Implementation**: Built comprehensive React-based log viewer at `/dashboard/experimental/logs`
  - Real-time log viewing with auto-refresh capabilities (5s, 10s, 30s, 1m intervals)
  - Dynamic category and script selection with intelligent filtering
  - Multi-level log filtering (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
  - Search functionality across log messages and script names
  - Export functionality for log analysis and archiving
  - Responsive design with dark mode compatibility

- **Enhanced UI Components**: Implemented colorized log level badges
  - ERROR: Red badges for critical issues
  - WARN: Orange badges for warnings
  - INFO: Blue badges for informational messages
  - DEBUG: Green badges for diagnostic information
  - Added corresponding icons for visual identification

## **üóëÔ∏è System Cleanup & Optimization**

### **Heartbeat Functionality Removal**

- **Complete Removal**: Eliminated deprecated heartbeat system and related components
  - Removed heartbeat hooks, API endpoints, and related infrastructure
  - Cleaned up unused code and dependencies
